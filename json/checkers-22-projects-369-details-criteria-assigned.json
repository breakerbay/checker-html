While temperature above 60 degrees C should be recorded as a fail, a measured temperature of slightly below 50 degrees C may be passed if the Assessor deems the system to; \no be otherwise safe and of reasonable standard to effectively supply hot water to the house, and\/or \no show daily fluctuations in temperature because of heating regime and usage profile, (for example a storage system heated on a night-rate and measured after heavy morning use). \n- Supply temperatures at the tap higher than 55 degrees C are a burn hazard, particularly for young and elderly people.\n- Temperatures lower than 60 degrees C in a storage cylinder, increase the risk of legionella bacteria.\n\nIt is not recommended that assessors touch or adjust thermostats."
