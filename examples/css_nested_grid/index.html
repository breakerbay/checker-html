    <div class="item criteria-description">Select the most easily locatable hot water tap which is closest to each hot water supply.
      - Measure temperature of water using either an electronic or analogue probe-style thermometer placed in the flow of the hot water supply.
      - Allow temperature to stabilise before confirming temperature.
      - Supplied temperature must not exceed 60°C.
      - Ensure that at least one measurement if taken for each separate hot water system in the house.

      Notes
      - The Assessor should place more emphasis on the upper limit (60 degrees C), than the lower limit (50 degrees C). While temperature above 60 degrees C should be recorded as a fail, a measured temperature of slightly below 50 degrees C may be passed if the Assessor deems the system to;
      o be otherwise safe and of reasonable standard to effectively supply hot water to the house, and/or
      o show daily fluctuations in temperature because of heating regime and usage profile, (for example a storage system heated on a night-rate and measured after heavy morning use).
      - Supply temperatures at the tap higher than 55 degrees C are a burn hazard, particularly for young and elderly people.
      - Temperatures lower than 60 degrees C in a storage cylinder, increase the risk of legionella bacteria.

      It is not recommended that assessors touch or adjust thermostats.</div>
