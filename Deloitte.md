# Draft Richard Hancock 2023-2024 Tax Preparation

Hi Paul,

attaching the details of my 2023-2024 tax in the zip file richard-hancock-2023-2024.zip for you to review and prepare for IRD.

In the zip file the document HancockTaxReturn2023-2024.pdf (or HancockTaxReturn2023-2024.docx if you prefer) provides the summary of my individual and rental income.

The zip file also contains the completed Deloitte individual and rental questionnaires, richard-hancock-nz-individual-questionniare-2023-2024.pdf and richard-hancock-nz-rental-property-questionnaire-2023-2024.pdf respectively.

Within the zip file the folders income-attachments and rental-expenses-attachments contain the receipts and other details supporting the income and rental expenses claims.

The main rental expense this year was painting the front exterior walls of the rental property, 137A Breaker Bay Road, Breaker Bay.

This painting is part of a longer term plan to fully repaint and repair the exterior, which was last painted almost 30 years ago.

With the work done this year approximately 50% of the exterior has now been repainted.

Feel free to contact me either by email or on my mobile 027 259 7224 if you need more details,


Cheers,
Richard Hancock
